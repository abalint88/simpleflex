# simpleflex

If you only need a grid and you already have scss processing in you project set up, this module is for you.

## features

This project is a total scss conversion of [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com) so you have any bootstrap like default classnames already in place.

## npm
`npm i grid-simpleflex --save`

## example usage

This may differ depending on your boundler and setup.

```SCSS
//import the whole grid
@import 'grid-simpleflex'
```

```SCSS
//import only what you need
@import 'grid-simpleflex/grid/container';
@import 'grid-simpleflex/grid/xs_grid';
@import 'grid-simpleflex/grid/sm_grid';
@import 'grid-simpleflex/grid/md_grid';
